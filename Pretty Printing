--In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding information acquired from a marketing agency.

--1. Show each copywriter's first_name and last_name in one column separated with a single space. Name the column name.
SELECT
	first_name ||' '|| last_name AS name
FROM copywriter;

--2. For each item, show the following sentence: 'ID X is Y.', where X is the id of the item and Y is its name. Name the column sentence.
SELECT 
  'ID ' || id ||' is '|| name ||'.' AS sentence
FROM item;

--3. For each slogan, show the following sentence (name the column: sentence): The copywriter of the slogan with ID X is Y Z. In this sentence, X is the id of the slogan, and Y and Z are the first and last name of the copywriter, respectively.
SELECT
  'The copywriter of the slogan with ID ' || s.id ||' is '|| c.first_name ||' '|| last_name ||'.' AS sentence
FROM slogan s
JOIN copywriter c
ON s.copywriter_id = c.id;

--4. For every slogan, show its id, its text, and its length. Name the last column text_length.
SELECT
	s.id,
    s.text,
    length(s.text) AS text_length
FROM slogan s;

--5. Show the IDs of all the items with a name longer than 8 characters. Show the length as the second column, name it name_length.
SELECT 
	ID,
  LENGTH(name) AS name_length
FROM item
WHERE LENGTH(name) > 8;

--6. The boss of the marketing agency heard that it's now very fashionable to write magazine and newspaper ads in lowercase letters. Let's check how it would look. For every slogan of the type 'newspaper ad' or 'magazine ad', show the slogan id and its text in lowercase as text_lowercase.
SELECT 
	ID,
  lower(text) AS text_lowercase
FROM slogan
WHERE type = 'newspaper ad' 
	OR type = 'magazine ad';
  
--7. The lowercase fashion is now passé. Everybody started to use upper case. Show the id of each 'newspaper ad' or 'magazine ad' slogan together with its text in capital letters. Name the second column text_uppercase.
SELECT 
	id,
  upper(text) AS text_uppercase
FROM slogan
WHERE type = 'newspaper ad'
OR type = 'magazine ad';

--8. The boss wants you to update the names of all the items so that they start with a capital letter, followed by lowercase. Show the id of each item together with its old name (as old_name) and updated name (as new_name).

  initcap(name) AS new_name
FROM item;
